# MilkMan
This Project has been inspired by the Digital India Campaign. The aim is to bring together Milkmen to the process of Digitalisation so that they dont feel left out and outdated.
The Project calculates the monthly bills for evey customer so that the milkman can keep a digital record of everyone without using any calculations and pen and paper. The project also takes into account days when the customer didn't take milk and deducts the cost for those days.The different prices for buffalo and cow milk have also been considered.

* As this is my first project it might have some flaws and bugs.
